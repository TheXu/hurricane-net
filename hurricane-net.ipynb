    "\n",
    "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provide predictions for storms trajectories, intensity, and size. They create these predictions based on models that can be classified into 3 groups: dynamical, statistical, and ensemble [1]. The most accurate models are based on computational fluid dynamics and achieve more precision than their statistical and ensemble counterparts [1][4]. The current statistical models (OCD5) are based on multiple regression methods that can explain a significant amount of variance [1]. In this project, we research and implement the domain of machine learning and deep learning into predictive hurricane models for both trajectory and intensity and evaluate them against the NHC standards. \n",
    "Previous research into machine learning to forecast tropical Atlantic storms include a sparse recurrent neural network (Kordmahalleh, Sefidmazgi, & Homaifar, 2016) and an artificial neural network (Jung & Das, 2013); both achieved favorable results. The hurricane models created can be utilized to develop more precise emergency planning. There is a necessity for more accurate and timely models that can help reduce the amount of loss caused by hurricanes. \n",

    "## Problem<a id=\"Problem\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The NOAA and NHC have several different classifications for Atlantic hurricane models that describe feature prediction and model architecture. The 3 main classifications for hurricane model architecture include dynamical, statistical, and ensemble. Classifications also include relative compute time required to create an output grouped as either early or late and forecast parameters such as trajectory, intensity, and wind radii. The most accurate models are late models that take upwards of 6 hours to produce an output whereas models that can produce an output in seconds to minutes are called early. Early models tend to be statistical which include the baseline model for trajectory named CLIPER5 Climatology and Persistence (CLP5) utilizing multivariate regression. The performance for these methods can be augmented by incorporating more advanced statistical methods from deep learning such as recurrent neural networks. Kordmahalleh et al., 2016 created a sparse recurrent neural network augmented by a genetic algorithm but there are factors requiring improvement. The training set utilized an older version of the NHC Hurricane Database format known as HURDAT while a new format has been released called HURDAT2 with additional information on wind radii. Kordmahalleh et al., 2016 also utilized benchmarks different from the standard applied within the NHC. Other than improving their methodology, we can expand the scope by creating separate models for both intensity and trajectory. These models can be used to predict the trajectory and intensity for future Atlantic storms.\n",

The most updated version of the dataset is included on the noaa.gov site and includes 2 additional years of cyclone data compared to the data set available on Kaggle and is potentially more descriptive. To match the inputs of the baseline model used by the NHC, we are calculating the forward motion of the storm by applying a vector based on previous and current geographical location.\n",

    "The NOAA and NHC also hosts a geographical information system (GIS) that contains raw and processed data on hurricanes. The server hosting the GIS is publicly accessible and can be used to evaluate our model by comparing the 2017 Atlantic tropical season.

Although we're dividing these steps into disctinct procedures, they are often more fluid and often have overlaps. The extraction phase consists of collecting and parsing the HURDAT2 and error forecast databases for analysis and benchmarking. The HURDAT2 database is our core foundation for creating the deep learning model. We store the database in its raw .txt format but it can be directly linked to the database hosted by the NHC."
